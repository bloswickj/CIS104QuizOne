6. A forward slash followed by a single asterisk indicated the end of a multi-line comment.
8. This turns on a strict mode in the language which does not allow as much 'forgiveness' in the way the code is written.
9. This is accessing a language library and setting it equal to the constant called 'PROMPT' so that we have easy local access to it in our code.
11. This is declaring a variable called 'continueResponse'.
12 This is declaring 4 more varibales. These are grouped by data type for easier reading of the code.
13-16. These lines are declaring and initializing constants.
18. Is the meathod signature line for the method 'main'. This method is also known as the dispatcher because it is used to call other methods. The open curly brace indicates the start of the block of code.
19. This line is used to clear the screen of the console in windows.
20. Calls the function called setContinueResponse.
21. The start of a while loop that runs as long as continueResponse is equal to and the same data type as 1.
22. Calls the function called setCurrentMonth.
23. Calls the function called setCurrentGrade.
24. Calls the function called setCurrentClassroom.
25. Calls the function called processPaymentCoupons.
26. Calls the function called setContinueResponse.
27. The start of a for loop that uses the variable i with a starting value of 0, i < MAX_CLASSROOM as the condition, and i++ (i = i + 1) as the incrementation.
28. Calls the function called printGoodbye.
29. Closing curly brace for the for loop.
30. Closing curly brace for the while loop.
31. Closing curly brace for the main method.
33. Calls the main function. 
35. The method signature line for setContinueResponse.
36. The start of an if statement. continueResponse != (is not) null is used as the test.
37. Sets continue response equal to -1.
38. The start of a while loop. continueResponse !== (not equal to and same data type as) 0 && continueResponse !== 1 is used as the test for the loop.
39. Sets continue response equal to the users input.
40. Closing curly brace for the while loop.
41. Closing curly brace for the if statement. Start of an else statement.
42. Sets continue response equal to 1.
43. Closing curly brace for the else statement.
44. Closing curly brace for the method.
46. The method signature line for setCurrentMonth.
47. Start of an if statement. currentMonth != (not equal to) null && (and) currentMonth <= (less than or equal to) MAX_MONTH is used as the test.
48. Increases current month by 1.
49. Close of if statement. Start of else statement.
50. Sets current month equal to 1.
51. Close of else statement.
52. Close of method.
54. Method signature line for setCurrentGrade.
55. Start of if statement. typeof currentGrade !== 'undefined' (another way of testing if a variables value has been set) && currentGrade <= MAX_GRADE is used as the test. Includes a single line comment.
